;;; Commentary:

;; Work in Progress.
;; Be warned: I learn emacs lisp as well as writing company backends in the
;; process of writing these, so don't expect this to be optimized.

;; Heavily inspired by the completion backends provided by company-auctex
;; https://github.com/alexeyr/company-auctex/

;; #####################
;; What currently Works:
;; #####################

;; Completion of expressions provided in a file (not if expression starts with
;; colon)

;; Completion of samples stored in sonic-pis default directory after the
;; "sample" command.

;; ####################
;; What doesn't work:
;; ####################

;; Completion of anything starting with anything but sample names starting with
;; a colon.

;; Context sensitive completion other than sample names after "sample" command

;; completion of user defined function and variables. Not sure if that will ever
;; work as long as the server has no documented api for this. I haven't really
;; looked into the inner workings of the sonic-pi gui to figure out how it
;; handles this - if you have feel free to tell me.

;; ###################
;; What you can do
;; ###################

;; Whatever you want but if you want to help me, tell me what I'm doing wrong
;; and why what I'm doing is wrong.
;; (pls no "lel emacs, use the gui – shithead")

;;; Installation:

;; The completion Backends need to be added to company modes backend list and
;; variables "company-sonic-pi-dict" and "sonic-pi-path" need to be set, the
;; latter is the same variable sonic-pi.el uses.
;; TODO: More specific Instructions.

;;; Usage:

;;; Code:

(require 'company)

(defun read-lines (filePath)
  "Return a list of lines of a file at filePath."
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file-contents filePath)

;; TODO make a proper list of sonic-pi expressions so it doesn't need to read
;; this file all the time.
